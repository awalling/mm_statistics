This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#Read in data from csv files and assign to variable names.  I have #provided the full path names, but if you are working from an R 
#Notebook or R Script in the same directory as the file you wish #to work with, you can provide the relative path name. 

mm_weight <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_weight.csv",
                      header=TRUE,
                      sep=",")
```

```{r}
#Here we add information about edge color with col, fill color
#with fill, and transparency with alpha.
#Additionally, we create a title and x and y axes labels with labs
#Finally, we define the edges of the plot axes with xlim and ylim
ggplot(data=mm_weight, aes(mm_weight$Weight.in.grams)) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(15,22,by=1),
                 col="red",
                 fill="green",
                 alpha= .2) +
  labs(title="Weight of Fun-Size Bags of Peanut M&M's") + 
  labs(x="Weight in grams", y="Counts") +
  xlim(c(15,22)) +
  ylim(c(0,10))
```
```{r}
#Add lines for the mean and median to your histogram:
ggplot(data=mm_weight, aes(mm_weight$Weight.in.grams)) + 
  
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(15,22,by=1),
                 col="red",
                 fill="green",
                 alpha= .2) +
  
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(Weight.in.grams)),color="black")+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(Weight.in.grams)),color="blue")+
  
  labs(title="Weight of Fun-Size Bags of Peanut M&M's") + 
  labs(x="Weight in grams", y="Counts") +
  
  xlim(c(15,22)) +
  ylim(c(0,10))
```

```{r}
#To get numerical values for your measures of central tendency, use
#Built-in functions provided by R.  

#The mean function is built in...
mean(mm_weight[,2])

#And so is the function for calculating the median!
median(mm_weight[,2])

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
