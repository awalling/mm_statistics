This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Install the ggplot2 package and load the package with the library
#function.
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#Read in data from csv files and assign to variable names.  I have #provided the full path names, but if you are working from an R 
#Notebook or R Script in the same directory as the file you wish #to work with, you can provide the relative path name. 
mm_colors <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_colors.csv",
                      header=TRUE,

#Load data into the ggplot function.  aes() is the aesthetics 
#function and instructs ggplot to map data to visual properties.
#geom_histogram() instructs ggplot that the shape of the plot
#is a histogram.

```{r}
#Here we modify our plot to define how the histogram will break 
#into bins, setting the lower and upper limit and the width of 
#each bin.

  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(15,22,by=1))

```{r}
#Here we add information about edge color with col, fill color
#with fill, and transparency with alpha.
#Additionally, we create a title and x and y axes labels with labs
#Finally, we define the edges of the plot axes with xlim and ylim

```{r}
#Here we create a histogram with a density function overlaid, #using the density function.  There are a few major modifications.
#First, in geom_histogram(), the aes() function maps the y-value
#to density.
#Second, we add a new geom to ggplot, geom_density(), and we
#set the color of the density plot to red.

#Here we create a bar plot for a different data set, mm_colors.
#Examine the data frame for mm_colors, and then look at the plot.
#We use the same basic syntax: we load data in the ggplot() 
#function, and we define the geometry of the plot with geom_bar().
#The syntax of geom_bar is a little different than #geom_histogram().  Importantly, we need to include the argument
#stat="identity" so that the geom_bar function knows which bars
#represent which colors.
mm_colors
ggplot(data=mm_colors, aes(x = Colors, y = Amount)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

```{r}
#Here, we adjust the width and fill color of our bar plot.
#We also alter the background theme of the plot with the 
#theme_minimal() function.
ggplot(data=mm_colors, aes(x = Colors, y = Amount)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5, fill="steelblue") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
#In order to change the fill color of each bar in our bar chart,
#We use ggplot(aes(fill=Colors)) to indicate we want to track 
#fill color with the Colors variable.
#We assign the colors to each category with scale_fill_manual().
ggplot(data=mm_colors, aes(x = Colors, y = Amount, fill=Colors)) +   geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5) +

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
