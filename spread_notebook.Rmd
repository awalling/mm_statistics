This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Load the ggplot library
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#Read in data from csv files and assign to variable names.  I have #provided the full path names, but if you are working from an R 
#Notebook or R Script in the same directory as the file you wish #to work with, you can provide the relative path name. 

mm_weight <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_weight.csv",
                      header=TRUE,
                      sep=",")
#Write a line of code to read in the csv file for mm_numbers

```

```{r}
#Use the built-in range function to calculate the range for the mm_weight and mm_numbers datasets.
range(mm_weight[,2])

#Write a line of code to calculate the range of mm_numbers
```
```{r}
#Calculate the interquartile range for both mm_weight and mm_numbers

IQR(mm_weight[,2])

#Write a line of code to calculate the interquartile range for mm_numbers


```

```{r}
#Not very informative on its own!  A more useful function is 
#the built-in R function summary(), which provides a number of useful summary statistics:

summary(mm_weight[,2])

#Write a line of code to print summary statistics for mm_numbers
```

```{r}
#Let's calculate variance and standard deviation for mm_weight:

#The variance...
var(mm_weight[,2])

#The standard deviation...
sd(mm_weight[,2])

#Remember your variance is always in units squared!
```

```{r}
#Let's create a boxplot to visualize the spread of our data.
#Later, we'll create a more elaborate version in ggplot, 
#But for now, let's just use R's built-in boxplot() function.

boxplot(mm_weight[,2])

#The rectangle shows the interquartile range, the black horizontal bar is the median, and the ticks at top and bottom show the highest and lowest values.
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
