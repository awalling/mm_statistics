This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Read in your mm_colors.csv dataset and print the dataframe:

mm_colors <- 

mm_colors
```

```{r}
#We have our observed values, mm_colors$Amounts, but we need our expected values.  The manufacturers of M&M's most recently published its color proportions in 2008, as follows: 

#24% blue, 20% orange, 16% green, 14% yellow, 13% red, 13% brown.

#Create a vector of proportions (using decimals) and label it exp_prop.  Be sure to re-order the proportions to be in the same order as in your mm_colors dataframe.

exp_prop <- 

#Check that all the proportions sum to 1!



```

```{r}
#There is a function for the chi-square test built in to R, chisq.test().  

#This function can be used to perform several types of chi-square tests, but to perform a Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit, it takes two arguments, x and p.

#The x argument is your vector of observed values.  The p argument is your vector of expected proportions.


chisq.test(x = mm_colors$Amount, p = exp_prop)

#The test outputs the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, and the p-value, which is based off of the pchisq() function, for the probabilities associated with the chi-square distribution.

```

```{r}
#Let's see whether we can create our own function for the chi-square test for goodness of fit that accomplishes the same result!

#If you're trying to remember what the syntax for creating a function is, use your z-test notebook as a reference.  

#Your chi-square function will need to accept some vectors as arguments, and may need to create other vectors inside the function.

#Calculating a p-value is a little complicated - we'll talk about this as a group.  We need to use the pchisq() function.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
