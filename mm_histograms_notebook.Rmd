This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
mm_weight <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_weight.csv",
                      header=TRUE,
                      sep=",")
mm_colors <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_colors.csv",
                     header=TRUE,
                     sep=",")
mm_numbers <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_numbers.csv", 
                       header=TRUE,
                       sep)

```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
