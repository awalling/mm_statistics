This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
#Read in data from csv files and assign to variable names.  I have #provided the full path names, but if you are working from an R 
#Notebook or R Script in the same directory as the file you wish #to work with, you can provide the relative path name. 
mm_weight <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_weight.csv",
                      header=TRUE,
                      sep=",")
mm_colors <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_colors.csv",
                     header=TRUE,
                     sep=",")
mm_numbers <- read.csv(file="~/mm_statistics/mm_numbers.csv", 
                       header=TRUE,
                       sep=",")
```

```{r}
#Print the data sets and examine each data frame.
mm_weight
mm_colors

```

```{r}
#Examine the output of the default hist() function.  
hist(mm_weight$Weight.in.grams)
```

```{r}
#Adjust the color, axes labels, and title of the histogram.
hist(mm_weight$Weight.in.grams,
     col="blue",
     main="Weight of Fun-Size Packets of Peanut M&M's",
     xlab="Weight in grams",
     ylab="Counts")

```

```{r}
#Create a vector of colors to assign to bars in the histogram.

     col=c("blue","red","green"),
     main="Weight of Fun-Size Packets of Peanut M&M's",
     xlab="Weight in grams",
     ylab="Counts")
```
```{r}
#Use the default barplot function.  To name each bar, use the names.arg=c() function to create a vector of names.
#Assign colors to each bar manually using col=c() to create a vector of colors.
barplot(mm_colors$Amount,
        names.arg=c("Blue","Brown","Green","Orange","Red","Yellow"),
        col=c("blue","brown","green","orange","red","yellow"),

        xlab="Color",
        ylab="Number per Package")
```

```{r}
#Examine the default output from the histogram function for a different data set, mm_numbers.  What's wrong with this picture?
hist(mm_numbers$X..in.bag)
```

```{r}
#Adjust the breakpoints for each bin by creating a vector of breakpoints with the breaks=c() function.  Why do we split the bins in between integer values?
hist(mm_numbers$X..in.bag,
     breaks=c(4.5,5.5,6.5,7.5,8.5),
     col="lightblue",

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
