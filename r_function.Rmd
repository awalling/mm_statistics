This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#First, let's grab some data: how about the mm_weight dataset?  Read in the .csv file.

mm_weight <- 


```

```{r}
#Let's create our own function to output the mean, median, and standard deviation for a vector or column from a data frame.

#We will name this function summarize

summarize <- function(x) {
  mean_x <- mean(x)
  median_x <- median(x)
  stdev_x <- sd(x)
  
  #the function cat, being called within summarize, is equivalent to print in Python
  #You can use it to print out strings and variables on the same line.
  #The symbol "\n" instructs R to create a new line.
  
  cat("Mean:",mean_x,"\n",
      "Median:",median_x,"\n",
      "Standard Deviation:",stdev_x)
}

#Call the function to test it out!
summarize()
```

```{r}
#Can you create a function to compute the Z-score for the mm_weight dataframe?

#What values do you need to know?  Refer to your z-test notebook from Thursday and your slides for hints that will help you.

z_score <- 
  


#Call the function.  Does it match the value for a Z-score you obtained last Thursday?
z_score()
```

```{r}
#Leave this blank to include modify your z-score function to calculate probabilities associated with each Z-score.
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
