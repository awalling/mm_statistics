This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Today we'll be using a dataset, cars, that is built into this distribution of RStudio.

#First, examine the structure of the dataframe cars using str().  How many vectors does this dataframe consist of?


#What is the sample size for observation of car speed?
```

```{r}
#Second, use the summary function to evaluate the central tendancy and spread of the speed vector from the cars dataframe.


```

```{r}
#There's a handy package, BSDA (for basic statistics and data analysis) that contains a function for the z-test.  Install the package and load the library:
install.packages("BSDA")
library(BSDA)
```

```{r}
#Today, I would like you to test whether the true mean for car speed is significantly greater than the assumed mean of 15 mph, with a standard deviation of 4 mph.

#To do this, we need to use the z.test function:

#Here's how the function works:
#To conduct a one-sample, upper-tailed Z-test (the same kind of test we conducted before)...

#Define the dataset with the argument x = cars$speed (This function will calculate the 
#sample mean x-bar for you)

#Define the population mean and standard deviation with mu and sigma.x

#Define the alternative hypothesis, that the true mean is greater than the assumed mean of 15
z.test(x = cars$speed, mu = 15, sigma.x = 4, alternative = "greater")

#How would you interpret the results of this z-test?
```

```{r}
#Now let's conduct a z-test on the weight of M&M's per package of fun-size peanut M&M's.

#What's the first thing we need to do?  Read in our data!

mm_weight <- 

mm_weight


```

```{r}
#Use the summary function to get a measure of central tendency and spread for this sample of M&M's:


```

```{r}
#The published value for the weight of a bag of fun-size peanut M&M's is 18 grams, with a standard deviation of 0.75 grams.  Let's test to see whether our sample of fun-size bags of peanut M&M's came from a population with a true mean value of at least 18 grams.

#What's our null hypothesis?

#What's our alternative hypothesis?

#Conduct the z test.  What values do you need to put in for x, mu, sigma.x, and alternative?

z.test()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
